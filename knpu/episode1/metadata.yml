title:  Building a RESTful API in Symfony Episode 1
summary: |
    Making RESTful APIs is hard. That's why we built an entire [REST series](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/rest)
    around understanding the most important concepts.
    
    In this series, we get to work: by building the same APIin the REST
    series, but leveraging all the amazing tools and libraries of the Symfony
    framework. If terminology like representations, resources, and hypermedia
    are new to you, start with the [REST series](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/rest)
    and then come back.

    In Episode 1, we'll start quick with:

    * Build your first functional POST endpoint
    * Decoding the Request body
    * Using forms to handle incoming data
    * Writing tests for your API
    * Handling data "seeding" for your tests
    * GET, PUT, DELETE and PATCH endpoints
    * Using the JMS Serializer
