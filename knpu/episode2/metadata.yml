title:  Symfony RESTful API: Errors (Episode 2)
summary: |
    In [episode 1](http://knpuniversity.com/screencast/symfony-rest), we
    added our basic endpoints *with* some nice tests (yes!).
    
    Now, we turn to a *huge* part of APIs: handling and returning consistent
    errors. Seriously, this is more important than you might think - which
    is why we're covering this in episode 2.

    So, let's handle errors, and let's do it gracefully:

    * Handling Form Validation errors and response
    * Disabling csrf_protection
    * Introducing the api-problem JSON format
    * Exception Listener!
    * Consistent errors *everywhere*: 404's, 500's, oh my!
    * Handling "extra fields" in your form

    The REST of the Symfony Series:
